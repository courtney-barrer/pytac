## Introduction
PyTAC is a package to help interface with ESO's Tools for Advanced Control (TAC).

PyTAC uses `scipy.signal` and python `control` library to manipulate transfer functions. It uses `sympy` for symbolic math and `graphviz` for plotting.

Currently, the package is in development

* Building and modifying TAC files 
* DOT and graphviz visualization of TAC files
* Compute empirical transfer functions

## Dependencies

* scipy
* control
* numpy
* matplotlib
* graphviz
* art
