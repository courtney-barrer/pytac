## Introduction
PyTAC is a package to help interface with ESO's Tools for Advanced Control (TAC).

PyTAC uses `scipy.signal` and python `control` library to manipulate transfer functions. It uses `sympy` for symbolic math and `graphviz` for plotting.

Currently, the package is in development

## Features

* Create filter transfer functions
* Analyse stability and performance of feedforward loops
* Generate TAC source code from filter transfer functions
* Convert TAC source code into human-readable block diagrams

## Dependencies

* scipy
* control
* numpy
* matplotlib
* graphviz
